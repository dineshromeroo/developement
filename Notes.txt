GitHub
GitHub is a web-based platform that is commonly used for version control and collaboration on software development projects. GitHub allows users to store and manage their code repositories, track changes to code over time, collaborate with others on code, and contribute to open-source projects.

GitHub provides various features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis to manage and organize code repositories. It also offers integration with other services, such as continuous integration and deployment, code review tools, and project management platforms.

GitHub is widely used in the software development industry, and it has a large community of developers who contribute to open source projects and share their code with others. It is owned by Microsoft, but it remains an open platform that supports a wide range of programming languages and technologies.
